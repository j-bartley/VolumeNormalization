You must install FFmpeg first:

Its easy enough but there is no installer, just put the unzipped file in program files and then create the system environment variable as described in the link

Idk if you got ruby installed but you need it

Just open the installer in this folder

After that you should be good to go, just pop the .rb and .bat in a folder with .mp4's and open the bat.
Some of the code my be only relevent to my file sctructure. Let me know.
